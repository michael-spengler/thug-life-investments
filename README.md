# Thug Life Investments
With this "Investment Protocol" you can increase your Ether holdings over time as long as prices go up.

## Scenario:
Please check the [index.ts](https://github.com/michael-spengler/thug-life-investments/blob/main/src/index.ts) to understand the scenario.


## Assumptions

1. If many actors apply this or a similar investment pattern, the interest rates might rise until a point where the algorithm would stop
2. At a certain price people might just stop selling so that no trading pair would be found
3. People with huge capital supply have probably applied such patterns in derivates based investments - reinvesting the price gains from a long derivate to buy more of the shares.

I'm still not 100 % sure whether or not there is a risk that this approach would accumulate too much money in a monopoly or oligopoly style. At the same time it is probably good to let promising investment patterns evolve transparently so that anyone has the chance to apply such patterns.
